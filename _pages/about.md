# About Me
* I am currently an senior engineer at Google working at the intersection of computer vision and machine learning.
* 
* My research interests lie in applying machine learning, particularly deep learning, to understanding visual data. 
I am facinated with exploring how to learn visual representations that generalizable to new domains/tasks with less labeled data. 
I also work on applications on medical images, e.g. image registration and segmentation.  
* I received my PhD on [Computer Vision and HCI](https://www.cis.rit.edu/) from University of California, Irvine 
where I worked with Prof. [Deva Ramanan](https://people.rit.edu/ndcsma/) on hand gesteure recognition and face tracking in the wild.

* Before joining Google, I was a staff research scientist at Intel, where I spent time on 3D body pose estimation and style transfer problems.
